# FoodOrder sample App

This app is based on beatcode boilerplate.
BeatCode is used as submodule, so that development phase is easier.

In future, when beatcode makes "production" phase, it should be used as std npm package, and typing reference should be changes in app/app.ts to different path.
Until then it uses beatcode through beatcode.d.ts inside scripts/beatcode folder.
